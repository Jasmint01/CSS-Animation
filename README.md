# CSS Animation
03-04-2022
 ### Objectives
Implementing some CSS Animations into your website. Some will be simple, while others are meant to add some flare to make your website fancy.
*Create a worm. The worm stretches across each side, going from a side to the top or bottom, to the other side, then the top or bottom that was not touched. (See Gif)
*The Worm by default is 100 by 100 px
*The worm is inside of a container that is 500px by 500px
*The box should stretch the entire side that its currently on and then shrink into its original 100 by 100 size before going to stretch to the other side
*Should be an infinite animation
*When stretching, the worm should slim to half of its thickness
